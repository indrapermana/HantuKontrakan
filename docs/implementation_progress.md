# Implementation progress

## P0 vertical slice

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-11.

- P0-01: Flutter scaffold, portrait orientation, Flame game surface, placeholder visuals.
- P0-02: two horizontal tappable room components with tappable ghost children.
- P0-03: deterministic seeded Pocong and Tuyul state.
- P0-04: pure Dart directional compatibility and capped happiness rules.
- P0-05: room detail sheet with numeric state and atomic tenant swap.
- P0-06: one scripted Pocong-versus-Tuyul complaint.
- P0-07: three previewed deterministic choices updating coins and happiness once.
- P0-08: schema-versioned local save/reload plus deterministic tests.

## M1 — Foundation and building prototype

### HK-001 — App foundation

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-11.

- Retained the existing Flutter + Flame P0 entry point and extracted the dark Material theme into `AppTheme`.
- Added named-route scaffolding with `/` as the home route.
- Added generated ARB localization for Indonesian and English and migrated the current Flutter HUD, room sheet, and complaint dialog copy.
- Retained runtime portrait locking and added portrait-only Android/iOS manifest declarations to prevent landscape presentation outside Flutter startup.
- Added tests for the named home route, both supported locales, and platform orientation declarations.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test`: all 12 tests passed, including 3 HK-001 foundation tests and all P0 regressions.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

## Scope intentionally deferred

- HK-002 and all later M1/M2 tickets beyond what P0 directly requires.
- Four-room economy, rent accrual, upgrades, furniture, random incidents, ads, IAP, analytics, cloud/network services, final artwork, and full localization.

## Verification evidence

- `/Users/indra/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart format lib test`: 20 files formatted successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test`: 9 tests passed. Coverage includes directional compatibility, adjacency and caps, atomic swapping, idempotent incident effects, controller reload, JSON persistence/corrupt-save fallback, and the visible Flutter complaint flow.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.
- Acceptance flow is covered by the widget and controller tests: initial Pocong happiness 35 from the −15 Tuyul penalty; soundproofing resolves the complaint once, changes coins 200 → 150 and happiness 35 → 55, then persists the resolved state.

## Remaining validation

- No emulator or physical-device session was attached, so touch interaction and cold restart were validated through automated tests and the Android build rather than a manual device run.
- A physical-device launch remains pending; Android bootability is currently evidenced by the successful debug APK build and automated widget tests.
