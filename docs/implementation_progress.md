## M1 — Foundation and building prototype

### HK-001 — App foundation

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-11.

- Retained the existing Flutter + Flame P0 entry point and extracted the dark Material theme into `AppTheme`.
- Added named-route scaffolding with `/` as the home route.
- Added generated ARB localization for Indonesian and English and migrated the current Flutter HUD, room sheet, and complaint dialog copy.
- Retained runtime portrait locking and added portrait-only Android/iOS manifest declarations to prevent landscape presentation outside Flutter startup.
- Added tests for the named home route, both supported locales, and platform orientation declarations.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test`: all 12 tests passed, including 3 HK-001 foundation tests and all P0 regressions.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

### HK-002 — 2×2 cutaway building

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-11.

- Expanded the Flame world to the specified 2×2 cutaway: rooms 03/04 on the upper floor and rooms 01/02 on the ground floor.
- Preserved Pocong and Tuyul in the existing lower rooms and added visibly locked presentation placeholders for the upper rooms.
- Kept all four rooms as Flame `TapCallbacks` components and routed their stable IDs into Flutter room sheets; locked rooms show a localized read-only explanation.
- Added a deterministic world test covering all four IDs, exact grid coordinates, locked-room state, and every selection callback.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test`: all 13 tests passed, including the new HK-002 layout/selection test and all prior regressions.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

### HK-003 — Pure Dart domain foundation

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-11.

- Hardened `GameState` so ghost and room collections are defensively copied and unmodifiable.
- Added sealed `SwapOccupants` and `ResolveComplaint` commands.
- Added a pure Dart `GameStateController` with deterministic dispatch, identity-preserving no-ops, and revision tracking.
- Updated the Flutter application controller to delegate transitions through typed commands while retaining notification and save behavior.
- Consolidated the established P0 complaint costs/effects and resolution ID in `GameBalance`.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test test/simulation test/application`: all 8 focused tests passed.
- `flutter test`: all 15 tests passed, including immutable-state and typed-command coverage plus all previous regressions.
- `rg 'package:(flutter|flame)' lib/simulation`: no matches; the simulation layer has no Flutter or Flame imports.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

### HK-004 — Versioned save/load and recovery

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-13.

- Replaced nullable/catch-all loading with explicit not-found, loaded, corrupt, and unsupported-version outcomes.
- Added strict schema-version validation and a dedicated unsupported-version exception before version-1 decoding.
- Preserved rejected SharedPreferences payloads at both the primary key and a recovery backup key.
- Seeded a safe playable state after rejection while exposing the recovery reason and avoiding writes during initialization.
- Retained save/reload survival for room swaps, complaint resolution, wallet changes, and happiness effects.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test test/services test/application`: all 7 focused persistence/application tests passed.
- `flutter test`: all 19 tests passed, including missing-save, round-trip, corrupt-save, unsupported-version, backup-preservation, fallback, and reload coverage.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

### HK-005 — Debug HUD and deterministic runtime

Status: implemented and verified on 2026-10-13. Milestone M1 is complete.

- Added a debug-only HUD showing coins, chaos, Pocong/Tuyul happiness, active tick count, injected clock time, and RNG seed.
- Added manual one-second tick and seeded-state reset controls, both routed through typed domain commands and persisted normally.
- Added injectable `GameClock` and resettable `SeededRandomSource` runtime dependencies with deterministic tests.
- Added persisted chaos and active simulation seconds under schema version 2, plus an explicit version-1 migration.
- Kept actual economy accrual, periodic chaos changes, incidents, and offline simulation outside HK-005.

Verification:

- Dart formatter completed successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- Focused simulation, runtime, persistence, and debug-HUD suite: all 22 tests passed.
- `flutter test`: all 24 tests passed, including deterministic clock/seed, RNG reset, tick/reset persistence, debug HUD, and v1 migration coverage.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

## Scope intentionally deferred

- HK-006 and all later M2 tickets.
- Four-room economy, rent accrual, upgrades, furniture, random incidents, ads, IAP, analytics, cloud/network services, final artwork, and full localization.

## Verification evidence

- `/Users/indra/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart format lib test`: 20 files formatted successfully.
- `flutter analyze`: no issues found.
- `flutter test`: 9 tests passed. Coverage includes directional compatibility, adjacency and caps, atomic swapping, idempotent incident effects, controller reload, JSON persistence/corrupt-save fallback, and the visible Flutter complaint flow.
- `flutter build apk --debug`: succeeded; artifact at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.
- Acceptance flow is covered by the widget and controller tests: initial Pocong happiness 35 from the −15 Tuyul penalty; soundproofing resolves the complaint once, changes coins 200 → 150 and happiness 35 → 55, then persists the resolved state.

## Remaining validation

- No emulator or physical-device session was attached, so touch interaction and cold restart were validated through automated tests and the Android build rather than a manual device run.
- A physical-device launch remains pending; Android bootability is currently evidenced by the successful debug APK build and automated widget tests.
